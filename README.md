### Description
#### This application will help pre-college students understand how much attending a Four Year University actually costs. User will input: The amount of cash they have on hand, they type of University they would like to attend, where they would like to live after they graduate, what they would like to study in school, and how aggressively they would like to pay back their student debt (should they have any). The application will return how long it will take to pay back their student debt given their provided parameters. If the student debt will take more than 40 years to pay back, the application will return how much debt will need to be paid after 40 years of payments have been completed. We hope this application will give prospective college students an idea of what they are getting themselves in to before they decide their educational path.
